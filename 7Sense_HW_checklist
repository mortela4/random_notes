Hardware checklist
===================

Introduction
-------------
This is a document to describe the process of
hardware design internally at 7Sense Technologies AS.

It is both a checklist and a review-procedure document,
aiming not only to reveal lack of planning, 
missing steps in design flow and other discrepancies, 
but also (hopefully) provide help in the process of 
enforcing good HW-design methodology.

'Good HW-design methodology' shall ultimately lead to a system 
with HW that operates reliant diregarding the SW that runs on it.
'Reliant' in this context can be interpreted as
* always operating within parametric limits (i.e. Iload <= Iload(max)) w.r.t. system inputs & outputs, 
  which ALWAYS include AT LEAST 5% margin w.r.t. critical values 
* always operates predictable (i.e. no undocumented states, and no unintentional bi-stable or oscillatory states),
  and with functional safety (i.e. always design with functional safety in mind; do NOT design away safety even if no safety requirements are given)
Both design goals assume failing SW, as a functionally correct HW-design cannot be dependent on functionally correct SW!
  
Note that this is an INTERNAL document, 
NOT a deliverable! It's target audience is primarily 
fellow HW & SW developers within 7Sense, 
not staff at contract manufacturers or external customers. 
This implies that content is adapted for those who are 
tasked with interpreting, comprehending and using the HW design.
Some points regarding PCB-specific characteristics are included, 
but a separate document shall be used for reviewing a design 
for 'manufacturing-readiness'.

- coupling w. other nets (e.g. differential, balanced signaling)
- HV isolation (isolation voltage in [V], minimum resistance between given net(s), or air-gap distance)
NOTE: net properties should ideally propagate to PCB layout tool! 
If this is NOT the case, and PCB-layout tool itself has no verification mechanisms, 
PCB layout shall either
- be extracted as back-annotated netlist with parasitics (R,L,C) and verified using simulation tool,
   or imported into schematic capture tool and verified there 
- or manually verified, using analytical methods (e.g. calculate worst-case propagation delay from PCB trace lengths) 
  or direct comparison (e.g. air-gap distances), with written digressions for those nets where properties were set in schematic,
  and supplied with a rationale for acceptance.
b) other constraints used (specify!) --> e.g. connection required, conditionally required or optional

2) Rules checking

- connectivity check (= "all nets connected?")
- I/O integrity 
  * no two outputs connected to each other, unless open drain or open-source or bidirectional 
  * pull-up/down where required --> have all INputs been analyzed for static level forcing?
- voltage compatibility --> OUTput connected to INput of same or compatible I/O voltage level and/or signalling type
