Hardware checklist
===================

Introduction
-------------
This is a document to describe the process of
hardware design internally at 7Sense Technologies AS.

It is both a checklist and a review-procedure document,
aiming not only to reveal lack of planning, 
missing steps in design flow and other discrepancies, 
but also (hopefully) provide help in the process of 
enforcing good design methodology.

Note that this is an INTERNAL document, 
NOT a deliverable! It's target audience is primarily 
fellow HW & SW developers within 7Sense, 
not staff at contract manufacturers or external customers. 
This implies that content is adapted for those who are 
tasked with interpreting, comprehending and using the HW design.
Some points regarding PCB-specific characteristics are included, 
but a separate document shall be used for reviewing a design 
for 'manufacturing-readiness'.  




Design review
--------------
1) Is project internal, or for external customer?

2) how is design planned
- from written specifications, provided by customer?
- from written specifications, 
  * if (any) YES, provide reference(s)!

2) how is the design implemented?
- based on reference design?
- input from software engineers
- design from scratch

3) is a block schematic provided?
- if NO give rationale

4) is a design interpretation presented?
- if NO give rationale
- if YES, is the interpretation recorded and accepted by team leader (and optionally the team)?

5) Is a test-strategy provided?

6) Overall project description.
a) Is a project design-description provided?
If YES, add reference:
If NO, give rationale:

NOTE: if none of the above component types are checked, 
the design is assumed to consist solely of connectors, signal routing and/or passive components!


Design tools and procedures
---------------------------

Tools:

1) list tools and versions thereof used for design

2) list tools and versions thereof used for verification

3) list and describe manual procedures used in design and verification, 
   especially cases where tools were not sufficient

4) Describe type and format of design-handoff deliverables (BOM etc.):


Design flow:

1) schematic properties
a) are PIN properties used? (YES/consistently, Partially, NO/excluded)
If YES, specify pin property types:
- direction --> out, in, bidirectional (applies both to ICs and connectors)
- type --> open-drain/source, CMOS(Rail-to-Rail), TTL, LVDS, analog, dedicated(e.g. USB) etc.
- fanout --> constrained(1:1/1:N = number of 'characterisic loads' - specify capacitance or current-drive), dedicated(Tx/Rx-pair) etc.
- drive --> [x]mA sink/source, SlewRate, Schmitt-trigger input, tristatable(OUTput) etc.
- I/O-voltage --> [V]-standard, multi-drive(given by Vdd_io) or range(specify Vhi(min), Vhi(max))
- STATIC (connected to Vcc or GND, directly or thorugh pull-up/down) or DYNAMIC(optionally specify max. switching frequency)
b) are NET properties used? (YES/consistently, Partially, NO/excluded)
If YES, specify net property types:
- current load 
- characteristic impedance (within min/max) at given frequency or frequency range
- coupling w. other nets (e.g. differential, balanced signaling)
- HV isolation (isolation voltage in [V], minimum resistance between given net(s), or air-gap distance)
NOTE: net properties should ideally propagate to PCB layout tool! 
If this is NOT the case, and PCB-layout tool itself has no verification mechanisms, 
PCB layout shall either
- be extracted as back-annotated netlist with parasitics (R,L,C) and verified using simulation tool,
   or imported into schematic capture tool and verified there 
- or manually verified, using analytical methods (e.g. calculate worst-case propagation delay from PCB trace lengths) 
  or direct comparison (e.g. air-gap distances), with written digressions for those nets where properties were set in schematic,
  and supplied with a rationale for acceptance.
b) other constraints used (specify!) --> e.g. connection required, conditionally required or optional

2) Rules checking
a) what types of DRC and/or ERC have been conducted?
- connectivity check (= "all nets connected?")
- I/O integrity 
  * no two outputs connected to each other, unless open drain or open-source or bidirectional 
  * pull-up/down where required --> have all INputs been analyzed for static level forcing?
- voltage compatibility --> OUTput connected to INput of same or compatible I/O voltage level and/or signalling type

3) Simulation & formal verification
a) were complete, functional simulation of design performed?
b) if YES to above 
- add reference to simulation results/output here:
- specify TYPE of simulation (analog, digital, both(separate) or co-sim/mixed-signal):
c) if NO to above, specify what part(s) were simulated:
* Power Supply/supplies
* analog part of design
* digital part of design 
  Specify type:
  * digital only, type PLC (ladder program or similar)
  * digital only, type HDL
  * Mixed HDL + SW co-simulation
  * true mixed-signal (e.g. HDL+AHDL, HDL+Spice co-sim. etc.)
* other (specify):
d) S-parameters extracted & analyzed, or critical nets verified as (2E8[m/s] / fmax) > 2*L ?
e) EMC simulation performed?
f) EMI simulation performed?
